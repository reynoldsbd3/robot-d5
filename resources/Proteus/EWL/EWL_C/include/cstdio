	/** The fscanf function reads input from the stream pointed to by stream, under control
	 *	of the string pointed to by format that specifies the admissible input sequences and how
	 *	they are to be converted for assignment, using subsequent arguments as pointers to the
	 *	objects to receive the converted input. If there are insufficient arguments for the format,
	 *	the behavior is undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess
	 *	arguments are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise ignored.
	 *	
	 *	The format shall be a multibyte character sequence, beginning and ending in its initial
	 *	shift state. The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more white-space
	 *	characters, an ordinary multibyte character (neither '%' nor a white-space character), or a
	 *	conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character '%'.
	 *
	 *	After the '%', the following appear in sequence:
	 *
	 *		An optional assignment-suppressing character '*'.
	 *
	 *		An optional decimal integer greater than zero that specifies the maximum field width
	 *			(in characters).
	 *
	 *		An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.
	 *
	 *		A conversion specifier character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
	 *
	 *	The fscanf function executes each directive of the format in turn. If a directive fails, as
	 *	detailed below, the function returns. Failures are described as input failures (due to the
	 *	occurrence of an encoding error or the unavailability of input characters), or matching
	 *	failures (due to inappropriate input).
	 *
	 *	A directive composed of white-space character(s) is executed by reading input up to the
	 *	first non-white-space character (which remains unread), or until no more characters can
	 *	be read.
	 *
	 *	A directive that is an ordinary multibyte character is executed by reading the next
	 *	characters of the stream. If any of those characters differ from the ones composing the
	 *	directive, the directive fails and the differing and subsequent characters remain unread.
	 *	Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a character from being
	 *	read, the directive fails.
	 *
	 *	A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as
	 *	described below for each specifier. A conversion specification is executed in the
	 *	following steps:
	 *
	 *	Input white-space characters (as specified by the isspace function) are skipped, unless
	 *	the specification includes a '[', 'c', or 'n' specifier.
	 *
	 *	An input item is read from the stream, unless the specification includes an n specifier. An
	 *	input item is defined as the longest sequence of input characters which does not exceed
	 *	any specified field width and which is, or is a prefix of, a matching input sequence.
	 *	The first character, if any, after the input item remains unread. If the length of the input
	 *	item is zero, the execution of the directive fails; this condition is a matching failure unless
	 *	end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the stream, in which
	 *	case it is an input failure.
	 *
	 *	Except in the case of a '%' specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a %n directive, the
	 *	count of input characters) is converted to a type appropriate to the conversion specifier. If
	 *	the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the directive fails: this
	 *	condition is a matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a '*', the
	 *	result of the conversion is placed in the object pointed to by the first argument following
	 *	the format argument that has not already received a conversion result. If this object
	 *	does not have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented
	 *	in the object, the behavior is undefined.
	 *
	 *	The length modifiers and their meanings are:

	 *
	 *	 d Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as

	 *
	 *	 a,e,f,g Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, infinity, or NaN, whose
	 *		format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the strtod
	 *		function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to floating.
	 *		(Available only when _EWL_FLOATING_POINT_PRINTF_SCANF is set).
	 *
	 *	 c Matches a sequence of characters of exactly the number specified by the field
	 *		width (1 if no field width is present in the directive).
	 *
	 *		If no 'l' length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
	 *		pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to accept the
	 *		sequence. No null character is added.
	 *
	 *		If an 'l' length modifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of multibyte
	 *		characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each multibyte character in the
	 *		sequence is converted to a wide character as if by a call to the mbrtowc
	 *		function, with the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object
	 *		initialized to zero before the first multibyte character is converted. The
	 *		corresponding argument shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of
	 *		wchar_t large enough to accept the resulting sequence of wide characters.
	 *		No null wide character is added.
	 *		(Available only when _EWL_WIDE_CHAR is set).
	 *
	 *	 s Matches a sequence of non-white-space characters.
	 *
	 *		If no 'l' length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
	 *		pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to accept the
	 *		sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added automatically.
	 *
	 *		If an 'l' length modifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of multibyte
	 *		characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each multibyte character is
	 *		converted to a wide character as if by a call to the mbrtowc function, with

	 *		to accept the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which will be
	 *		added automatically.
	 *		(Available only when _EWL_WIDE_CHAR is set).
	 *
	 *	 [ Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from a set of expected characters
	 *		(the scanset).
	 *
	 *		If no 'l' length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
	 *		pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to accept the
	 *		sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added automatically.
	 *
	 *		If an 'l' length modifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of multibyte
	 *		characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each multibyte character is

	 *
	 *		The conversion specifier includes all subsequent characters in the format
	 *		string, up to and including the matching right bracket (]). The characters
	 *		between the brackets (the scanlist) compose the scanset, unless the character
	 *		after the left bracket is a circumflex (^), in which case the scanset contains all
	 *		characters that do not appear in the scanlist between the circumflex and the
	 *		right bracket. If the conversion specifier begins with [] or [^], the right
	 *		bracket character is in the scanlist and the next following right bracket
	 *		character is the matching right bracket that ends the specification; otherwise
	 *		the first following right bracket character is the one that ends the
	 *		specification. If a '- 'character is in the scanlist and is not the first, nor the
	 *		second where the first character is a '^', nor the last character, the behavior is
	 *		implementation-defined.
	 *
	 *	 p Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which should be the
	 *		same as the set of sequences that may be produced by the %p conversion of
	 *		the fprintf function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to a
	 *		pointer to void. The input item is converted to a pointer value in an
	 *		implementation-defined manner. If the input item is a value converted earlier
	 *		during the same program execution, the pointer that results shall compare
	 *		equal to that value; otherwise the behavior of the %p conversion is undefined.
	 *
	 *	 n No input is consumed. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
	 *		signed integer into which is to be written the number of characters read from
	 *		the input stream so far by this call to the fscanf function. Execution of a
	 *		%n directive does not increment the assignment count returned at the
	 *		completion of execution of the fscanf function. No argument is converted,
	 *		but one is consumed. If the conversion specification includes an assignmentsuppressing
	 *		character or a field width, the behavior is undefined.
	 *
	 *	 % Matches a single % character; no conversion or assignment occurs. The
	 *		complete conversion specification shall be %%.
	 *	
	 *	If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.
	 *	
	 *	The conversion specifiers 'A', 'E', 'F', 'G', and 'X' are also valid and behave the same as,
	 *	respectively, 'a', 'e', 'f', 'g', and 'x'.
	 *	
	 *	Trailing white space (including new-line characters) is left unread unless matched by a
	 *	directive. The success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is not directly
	 *	determinable other than via the %n directive.
	 *
	 *	Returns the value of the macro EOF if an input failure occurs before any conversion.

	 *		adjustment flag, described later, has been given) to the field width. The field width
	 *		takes the form of an asterisk '*' (described later) or a nonnegative decimal integer.
	 *
	 *	- An optional precision that gives the minimum number of digits to appear for the 'd', 'i',
	 *		'o', 'u', 'x', and 'X' conversions, the number of digits to appear after the decimal-point
	 *		character for 'a', 'A', 'e', 'E', 'f', and 'F' conversions, the maximum number of significant
	 *		digits for the 'g' and 'G' conversions, or the maximum number of bytes to be written for

	 *		conversion specifier, it is ignored.

	 *
	 *	- A conversion specifier character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
	 *	
	 *	As noted above, a field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated by an asterisk. In

	 *	followed by a positive field width. A neg ative precision argument is taken as if the
	 *	precision were omitted.

	 *	The flag characters and their meanings are:

	 *	 '-' The result of the conversion is left-justified within the field. (It is right-justified if
	 *		this flag is not specified.)
	 *
	 *	 '+' The result of a signed conversion always begins with a plus or minus sign. (It
	 *		begins with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not
	 *		space If the first character of a signed conversion is not a sign, or if a signed conversion
	 *		results in no characters, a space is prefixed to the result. If the space and '+' flags
	 *		both appear, the space flag is ignored.
	 *	
	 *	 '#' The result is converted to an ‘‘alternative form’’. For 'o' conversion, it increases
	 *		the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a
	 *		zero (if the value and precision are both '0', a single '0' is printed). For 'x' (or 'X')
	 *		conversion, a nonzero result has 0x (or 0X) prefixed to it. For 'a', 'A', 'e', 'E', 'f',
	 *		'F', 'g', and 'G' conversions, the result of converting a floating-point number always
	 *		contains a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. (Normally, a
	 *		decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit
	 *		follows it.) For 'g' and 'G' conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the
	 *		result. For other conversions, it is ignored.
	 *
	 *	 '0' For 'd', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'x', 'X', 'a', 'A', 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F', 'g', and 'G' conversions,
	 *		leading zeros (following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width
	 *		rather than performing space padding, except when converting an infinity or NaN. If the

	 *	
	 *	f,F A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted to
	 *		decimal notation in the style [.]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
	 *		the decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification. If the

	 *	e,E A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the

	 *			otherwise, the conversion is with style e (or E) and precision P - 1.
	 *		Finally, unless the '#' flag is used, any trailing zeros are removed from the
	 *		fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point character is removed if
	 *		there is no fractional portion remaining.
	 *		A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style

	 *		(Available only when _EWL_FLOATING_POINT_PRINTF_SCANF is set)
	 *	
	 *	a,A A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
	 *		style [-]0xh.hhhh p±d, where there is one hexadecimal digit (which is
	 *		nonzero if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and is
	 *		otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point character and the number
	 *		of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is
	 *		missing and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient for
	 *		an exact representation of the value; if the precision is missing and
	 *		FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient to
	 *		distinguish values of type double, except that trailing zeros may be
	 *		omitted; if the precision is zero and the '#' flag is not specified, no decimal
	 *		point character appears. The letters abcdef are used for a conversion and
	 *		the letters ABCDEF for 'A' conversion. The 'A' conversion specifier produces a
	 *		number with X and P instead of x and p. The exponent always contains at
	 *		least one digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the
	 *		decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent is zero.
	 *		A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
	 *		of an 'f' or 'F' conversion specifier.
	 *		(Available only when _EWL_FLOATING_POINT_PRINTF_SCANF and _EWL_C99_PRINTF_SCANF are set)

	 *	c If no 'l' length modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an
	 *		unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
	 *
	 *		If an 'l' length modifier is present, the wint_t argument is converted as if by
	 *		an ls conversion specification with no precision and an argument that points
	 *		to the initial element of a two-element array of wchar_t, the first element
	 *		containing the wint_t argument to the 'lc' conversion specification and the
	 *		second a null wide character.
	 *		(Available only when _EWL_WIDE_CHAR is set)
	 *
	 *	s If no 'l' length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
	 *		element of an array of character type. Characters from the array are written
	 *		up to (but not including) the terminating null character. If the precision is 
	 *		specified, no more than that many bytes are written. If the precision is not
	 *		specified or is greater than the size of the array, the array shall contain a
	 *		null character.
	 *
	 *		If an 'l' length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
	 *		element of an array of wchar_t type. Wide characters from the array are
	 *		converted to multibyte characters (each as if by a call to the wcrtomb
	 *		function, with the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object
	 *		initialized to zero before the first wide character is converted) up to and
	 *		including a terminating null wide character. The resulting multibyte
	 *		characters are written up to (but not including) the terminating null character
	 *		(byte). If no precision is specified, the array shall contain a null wide
	 *		character. If a precision is specified, no more than that many bytes are
	 *		written (including shift sequences, if any), and the array shall contain a null
	 *		wide character if, to equal the multibyte character sequence length given by
	 *		the precision, the function would need to access a wide character one past the
	 *		end of the array. In no case is a partial multibyte character written.
	 *		(Available only when _EWL_WIDE_CHAR is set)
	 *	
	 *	p The argument shall be a pointer to void. The value of the pointer is
	 *		converted to a sequence of printing characters, in an implementation-defined
	 *		manner.
	 *
	 *	n The argument shall be a pointer to signed integer into which is written the
	 *		number of characters written to the output stream so far by this call to
	 *		fprintf. No argument is converted, but one is consumed. If the conversion
	 *		specification includes any flags, a field width, or a precision, the behavior is
	 *		undefined.
	 *
	 *	R,r Power Architecture SPE extension, The argument shall be unsigned (signed) fixed
	 *		point.
	 *		(Available only when _EWL_C99_PRINTF_SCANF && _EWL_FLOATING_POINT_PRINTF_SCANF are set)
	 *
	 *	% A % character is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
	 *		specification shall be %%.
	 *
	 *	If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined. If any argument is
	 *	not the correct type for the corresponding conversion specification, the behavior is
	 *	undefined.
	 *	
	 *	In no case does a nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of a field; if the result
	 *	of a conversion is wider than the field width, the field is expanded to contain the
	 *	conversion result.
	 *
	 *	For a and A conversions, if FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the value is correctly rounded
	 *	to a hexadecimal floating number with the given precision.
	 *
