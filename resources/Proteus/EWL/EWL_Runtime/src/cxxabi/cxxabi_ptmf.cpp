2.3 Member Pointers 

A pointer to data member is an offset from the base address of the class object
containing it, represented as a ptrdiff_t. It has the size and alignment attributes
of a ptrdiff_t. A NULL pointer is represented as -1. 

A pointer to member function is a pair as follows: 

ptr: 
For a non-virtual function, this field is a simple function pointer.
(Under current base Itanium psABI conventions, that is a pointer to a GP/function
address pair.) For a virtual function, it is 1 plus the virtual table offset (in bytes)
of the function, represented as a ptrdiff_t. The value zero represents a NULL pointer,
independent of the adjustment field value below. 

adj: 
The required adjustment to this, represented as a ptrdiff_t. 

It has the size, data size, and alignment of a class containing those two members,
in that order. (For 64-bit Itanium, that will be 16, 16, and 8 bytes respectively.)
